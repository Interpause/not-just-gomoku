-^MarkovAgent separate class, MarkovAgents inherit from MarkovAgent and the agent they are based on
-^hmm saving and loading works. good.

Create a set of special heuristics specifically for 5 in a row (gomoku)
-differentiate between OXXXO XXOXO XXOOX XXXXO XXOXX etc etc
-find out more about the clustering and ladder strategies
-figure out if above can be generalized to higher numbers
