# Not Just Gomoku

It is basically Gomoku, but with a board of any specified size, any specified number of players and any specified number of pieces in a row to win.

## Description

Run game.py and modify the settings there to see how it works. As it deviates from regular Gomoku quite a bit, I decided not to use hardcoded strategies (not that I knew any). Instead I used search agents. That said, the many actions possible each turn result in it being quite slow. Perhaps the search agents should be a fallback method if soft strategies fail. 

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at <https://interpause.github.io/not-just-gomoku/>. It was auto-generated from docstrings in code using [pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/).

## Archive note

This was something I made when I was 16. I would like to think that I have gotten more professional since then, but have I really? Anyways, since I have fond memories of coding this whenever I had free time in the school library, I have decided to come back and add documentation, while leaving the code itself as untouched as possible.

Since then, I have picked up the use of a proper IDE (VSCode) rather than using IDLE to code. I have learnt to rely on the work of others, instead of thinking that I should do everything myself. That said, back then, I was already a fairly decent coder, using what I was taught in computer elective to make game agents, planning my code for future extendability, and most importantly, coding for my own passion. Now that I do intend to make coding my career, I need to be more professional, which I hope I already am close to being with my more recent projects.

To be honest though, I miss those simpler days. I cannot fully remember what was going through my head at that time, but I do know it was fun.
